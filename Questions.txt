Open Technical Questions

* In Content.js, for example, where should I put the functions not related to the component?
* Where are variables that are declared outside the component scoped to?
Where should code like that IntervalPlayer and related functions go?
=>  One the one hand this component is small and there is no reuse of this code in sight, so it could just stay here
=> On the other probably more and more player functions will be coming up so a playerHelper could be an option if that
   is good practice in React? 
// Can timing the sound be done with start(0) stop(1)?

Notes

* At the moment the intervals for the exercise are specified by the intervals present in the INTERVALS constant.

Todos

* Create extra layer in Content component, if needed. Think about the problem and understand the solutions;
  => Maybe content is just the switch for the About, Settings, Practice, Stats pages?
* Think of a mechanism to dynamically set the intervals for a challenge (and prepare for other params too)
* Should Challenge and Answer be one Component?
* most basic user/auth => basic stats
* finsihed exercise markup
* repeat interval option
* in exercise stats
* Improve the sound with an envelope and in the future provide several optiosn incl. samples
